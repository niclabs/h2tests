# Testing HTTP/2 parameters for IoT

This is a collection of scripts to perform an evaluation of ideal settings for running HTTP/2 on constrained devices and constrained networks. For now, constrained devices means A8 devices, since there are no HTTP/2 implementations for low power devices yet (we're working on one). 

Tests are performed using the [IoT-Lab](https://www.iot-lab.info) platform
